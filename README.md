# Distributed Systems
Final tasks for the subject of distributed systems at the University of Ã‰vora.

## Distributed System
It's a **stock management system**, not only does it keep a log of the stock of a given store but it also lets users of the community request products.

Firstly a user must connect to the server and then the user can report the need for a product, check the current store's stock, or inform the system of products a store is selling.

This task was done using [**RMI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_remote_method_invocation) and the ***middleware*** concept.

 
## Fullstack Website
The task consists of a **website** where users can share a store's capacity.

This project was done using [**Spring Boot**](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and makes use of components as [**Spring Security**](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) and [**Spring JPA**](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) .
To better visualize the data [*Leafletjs*](https://leafletjs.com/), a *javascript* library was also used to show the place of the store on a map.
