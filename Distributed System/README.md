Final tasks for the subject of distributed systems at the University of Ã‰vora.

## Distributed System
It's a **stock management system**, not only does it keep a log of the stock of a given store but it also lets users of the community request products.

Firstly a user must connect to the server and then the user can report the need for a product, check the current store's stock, or inform the system of products a store is selling.

This task was done using [**RMI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_remote_method_invocation) and the ***middleware*** concept.
